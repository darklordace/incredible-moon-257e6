      - title: Where does The Glow Letter Co deliver to?
        content: >+
          ​We include free delivery within 1 hour drive of the Brisbane and
          Sydney CBDs. Shipping and self setup is also possible - if your event
          is outside of these areas please contact us for further information.
          We have setup teams located in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra
          and Hobart.

      - title: How long does it take to set up?
        content: >+
          With easy access to your venue and a power outlet, glow letter lights
          can be setup within 15 minutes. Please allow more time for difficult
          locations, long words, long power runs or if colour matching is
          required.


          Alternatively setting the letters up yourself is super easy! We can
          provide a 10 minutes tutorial on how to set the letters up and you'll
          be a pro.

      - title: Can I use your letters outdoor?
        content: "Sure!\_Glow Letters make a great addition to any event, indoors our outdoors as long as you have access to a power outlet. \n\nHowever, Glow Letters don't like the rain and power should be disconnected if it's raining. For safety the Glow Letters operate at low voltage and the power supply is enclosed in a weather sealed box.\_\n\n"
      - title: Do I need to provide power?
        content: >+
          Yes. If power isn't available, contact us and we can talk to you about
          other options including generators and batteries to get your letters
          glowing!


          Each Glow Letter uses a small amount of power thanks to the latest LED
          technology. Glow Letters are happily powered by a regular outlet,
          alongside other audio and lighting equipment. For a calculation
          particular to your letter combination please contact us and we can
          quickly calculate it for you.

      - title: What letters are available?
        content: "We can provide any combination of letters from A-Z, numbers from 0-9 along with\_♡,\_⇧, &, @ and #. We can also provide customised symbols or logos: please contact us to discuss pricing for custom letters.\n\n"
